### Hilton Assessment challenge 1.


To view the project, simply open the index.html file in a browser, please be sure to view it in a mobile window.

During this challenge, I decided to build it from scratch even though I generally prefer to use standardized Frontend Libraries like Bootstrap.

In this challenge, the assets supplied did not match up to the content displayed in the mock up (mainly the logo provided.)

Due to this inconsistency, I have made the header navigation a black color as the logo provided was not a png or SVG and I do not own Photoshop. 

I used semantic HTML to represent the different components on the page.

1st being the header with the navigation.
Then the article representing the Hotel Information.

Inside the article, there was a main image, a header element with the name of the hotel, an <address/> to wrap the address, and a telephone number.


Below this was a list of links.

There was no Footer provided in the mock So I put in a basic footer with the basic copyright jargon.


I decided to use a Block, Element, Modifier class naming standard as it keeps the code clean, easy to edit, and easy to read.

I used Sass because of it's ease to create very clean stylesheets that are very easy to read, and works extremely well with BEM standards.
